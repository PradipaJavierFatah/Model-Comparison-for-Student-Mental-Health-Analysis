# Model Comparison for Student Mental Health Analysis  

This repository contains a project aimed at analyzing and predicting the mental health of students, with a focus on depression. The project leverages a dataset from Kaggle to compare various machine learning models and identify the most effective method for mental health prediction.  

## 📌 Features  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing raw data for analysis.  
- **Model Comparison**: Evaluating multiple machine learning models for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
- **Predictive Analysis**: Generating predictions to identify students at risk of depression.  

## ⚙️ Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**:  
  - NumPy & Pandas (Data manipulation)  
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data visualization)  
  - Scikit-learn (Machine learning models and evaluation)  

## 📊 Dataset  
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and includes information on student mental health. For privacy and ethical reasons, sensitive data has been anonymized.
